  sentences:
  - "Hello, detective Pier. You failed, again\u2026 Dude  is a killer. Listen to
    how it all happened\u2026"
  - "Klinton was abusive husband, he often hit Ann and screamed on her. She had a
    lover \u2013 his best friend Peter. Probably she thought about leaving her husband
    and going to Peter. That day, when murder was commited, Klinton was in the bar.
    He played billiards at the bar. One of his rules was \u201CNever drink alcohol\u201D."
  - "That is why he usually quarreled at the bar with drunks. That day he seriously
    quarreled with drunk man who call himself Dude. Few years ago Dude stole money
    in the Klintons\u2019 home. He ruined everything in the house. That is why he
    was aware that Klinton had harpoons in the closet."
  - "Now listen the most interesting. Ann came back to home at 19:00, not at 23:00,
    it was a lie. She had a time to clean up evidences and add new against a competitor.
    She stole boots from Kira. He is a neighbor, so it took not a lot of time. She
    put on Kiras\u2019 boots and left marks on the floor. "
  - After she threw boots into the sea, but one of them didn't drown. Her motivation
    is very simple. She wanted to kill two rabbits with one shot. Leave her husband
    for Peter and get rid of a business competitor. We'll jail Dude for murder and
    Anna for hindering the investigation.
