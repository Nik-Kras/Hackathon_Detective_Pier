  - 'Uh.. '
  - We've been best friends for a long time. We started a fishing business together
    and starting as a poor fishers we became good wealth men.
  - 'Klinton was strong and in some case rude man. He set a couple of rules for work,
    like: no alcohol, start working as early as you can, all money should be spend
    on family or on improving fishing equipment. '
  - 'That is why now Klintons family have such good tools that even a wife can handle
    them. Or they can sell it can sell at a good price, so that they can get money
    for a while. '
  - Sorry, this was out of topic.
